# Course Syllabus: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Author:** Shah Mir Usman  
**Institution:** Panaversity & GIAIC     

## Abstract
This extensive curriculum bridges the gap between software intelligence and physical embodiment. It is designed for engineers who demand rigor, mathematical proof, and production-grade implementation details.

## The Pillars of Embodiment
1.  **Perception:** Converting photons and voltage into semantic understanding.
2.  **Reasoning:** Determining intent and future states (Cognition).
3.  **Actuation:** Converting digital signals into physical force (Newtonian interaction).

## Hardware Reference
* **High-Level:** Cloud-based H100s or local RTX 4090s.
* **Mid-Level:** Jetson Orin Nano (Edge AI).
* **Low-Level:** STM32/ESP32 microcontrollers.
