# Course Syllabus: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**Author:** Shah Mir Usman  
**Institution:** Panaversity & GIAIC     

## Abstract

This curriculum delivers a rigorous deep dive into the fusion of artificial intelligence with physical robotic systems. It targets learners who want to master the complete pipeline—ranging from theoretical understanding to building production-grade humanoid robots capable of perception, reasoning, and physical interaction with real-world environments. The course emphasizes mathematical foundations, instrumentation, algorithmic precision, and hands-on engineering practices that reflect the standards of elite research institutions and cutting-edge robotics labs.
Students will transition from foundational physics and control theory to full-stack embedded intelligence, enabling them to design, simulate, and deploy intelligent machines that move, interpret sensory input, learn autonomously, and interact with humans safely and efficiently.

## The Pillars of Embodiment
1.  **Perception:** Converting photons and voltage into semantic understanding.
2.  **Reasoning:** Determining intent and future states (Cognition).
3.  **Actuation:** Converting digital signals into physical force (Newtonian interaction).

## Hardware Reference
* **High-Level:** Cloud-based H100s or local RTX 4090s.
* **Mid-Level:** Jetson Orin Nano (Edge AI).
* **Low-Level:** STM32/ESP32 microcontrollers.
